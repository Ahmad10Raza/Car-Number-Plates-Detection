## Features

- **Number Plate Detection**: Detect car number plates in images and video frames.
- **Number Plate Recognition**: Recognize and extract text from the detected number plates.
- **EasyOCR Integration**: Utilizes the EasyOCR library for efficient optical character recognition.
- **Versatile**: Can be adapted for different languages, regions, and number plate designs.
- **Real-time Processing**: Designed for real-time applications in traffic management, security, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [EasyOCR](https://github.com/jaidedai/easyocr)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install easyocr numpy
```
## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmad10Raza/Car-Number-Plates-Detection.git
cd Car-Number-Plates-Detection
```

2. Install the necessary packages as mentioned in the Requirements section.

## Usage

1. Replace `your_image_path.jpg` with the path to the image or video frame you want to process in the Python script.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
